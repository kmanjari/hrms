# Editor PHP example scripts

The files in this directory are the PHP server-side scripts that are used by the
Editor examples with a PHP back-end, making use of the provided PHP libraries in
the Editor package (see the `php` directory at the top level of the Editor
package).

For full information on using the Editor PHP libraries, please refer to the
Editor manual online:

If you are interested in using Editor with a server-side environment that does
not have PHP available, please refer to the client / server communication
protocol that Editor uses, for information on how to write server-script scripts
that will operate with Editor:
